In this project, I created a multiple linear regression model to predict the housing price using the Boston housing dataset.

Key takeaways:
* Crime rate has a negative impact on the house price.
* Number of room, student-teacher ratio, and distance to business center have positive impact on house price.
* Number of room has the highest positive impact on house price.
* The residual vs fitted value scatter plot shows the residual fluctuate around zero, indicates no homoskedasticity.
* The VIFs all of features were under 2, indicate no multicollinearity.
